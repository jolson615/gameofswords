# gameofswords

Let's build out a video game. All I know right now is that it will have swords in it.

*kids name the game whatever they want*

Cool. So I've been thinking about what attributes, abilities, or traits we will need in order to create (initialize) each character. One that's on my mind is that we'll need like... attack power or strength or something. Each character will also need a name. What else do they need?

*kids usually get health, defense, attacking, defending, training, and then some other cool ideas.*

Okay, so we've got some things that are just like... facts. Those we can hardcode in. (Name)

Now, what's the best way to decide how much attack, defense, etc. each character gets on startup.

*kids usually arrive at random numbers pretty quickly. Then press them on ways that this system could be too random (unfair) or not random enough (boring, stagnant, predictable)*

*Once you've coded through the mvp included in this repo, everything else flows from one simple series of questions.*

What else should a character be able to do?
Let's test it out and see how it works.
How can we make that more fun / fair?
